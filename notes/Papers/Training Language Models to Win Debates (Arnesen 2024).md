Setting: reading comprehension questions from QuALITY. Judge cannot see the full text of the underlying short story, but the debaters can selectively reveal quotes from the text. 

Motivation behind setting: judge is inferior to debaters through information

Main comparison: debate vs consultancy
- Debate: adversarial truth system
- Consultancy: model convinces judge without another debater present

Result: "In contrast to our results on debate, we do not find a positive relationship between optimization pressure and judge accuracy for our non-adversarial consultancy baselines."

Debaters:
- First trained on human debaters and GPT-4 debaters, also add instruction-following from the Alpaca dataset to keep instruction-following capabilities
- Then do DPO, with modification to make DPO reward-aware (See NVIDIA's reward-aware preference optimization)
	- Reward function: expected confidence that the judge will have in their position at the end of the debate after that speech
	- Sampling: branching rollouts -- get two completions for each prompt

Results 
1. DPO makes 8B models more convincing to GPT-4 and its variants
2. Models trained to debate learn helpful policies at a higher rate than models trained to consult
3. "Explicit refutation doesn't play a role in judge decision making in our setting"
	1. *Experiment setup is likely to blame for this -- not instructing models to do argument resolution, nor is there diverse evidence that provides much contradicting arguments -- debates come down to intra-evidence debates about what a piece of evidence says (in which case it makes sense that the best thing for the judge is just to have more of the ev., but when we get inter-evidence debate we might get a lot more explicit refutation, and potentially argument resolution/comparison if models can learn it) 

Debate round victories are more correlated across judges than consultancy rounds -- debate training might be teaching "generally useful or informative argumentation strategies" in comparison with consultancy, which might overfit to a specific judge (Pearson corrrelation of 0.98 between the untrained and trained GPT judges on debate, while on consultancies only 0.51 in Arnesen 2024)
